Table. Estimates of Evolutionary Divergence between Sequences
The number of base differences per site from between sequences are shown. The analysis involved 24 nucleotide sequences. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 755 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA5 [1].
